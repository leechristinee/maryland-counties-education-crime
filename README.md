INST462 Final Project (Data Analytics &amp; Visualizations)

We obtained our dataset from data.gov, which contains open data from the US government. Our first dataset includes information on education attainment levels across counties in Maryland https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/choose-maryland-compare-counties-education. 

Our second dataset includes information on violent and property crimes by county in Maryland https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/violent-crime-property-crime-by-county-1975-to-present. We used the crime rates to explore the relationship between crime and educational attainment in different counties.

Our visualizations aim to communicate the relationship between education attainment levels and crime rates across Maryland counties. Specifically, we aim to explore whether increased high school graduation rates and higher percentages of individuals with bachelor’s degrees—may be linked to lower crime rates, especially for violent and property crimes. We focus on comparing data from two years, 2014 and 2018, to explore if there is a noticeable trend over time.
